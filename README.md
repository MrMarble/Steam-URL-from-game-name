This script compares a local game list with the steam store to find out the game url by it's name.
It's quite simple so don't expect magic from it.

# Requisites

You only need Python > 3.x and requests module. You can install it by using `pip install requests`

# How to

You'll need a file named games.txt right beside main.py filled with the name of the games you want to obtain the url for. One per line.

Then simply run `python main.py` and it will download a json file with all the games on steam and compare them.

It's spaghetti code and half of it is in Spanish, I did it for a Spanish Gaming community.
